        <p> Hello lovelies! Welcome to my "about me" page! You are probably here because you are photographer shopping! 
            Woot woot! Well I'm so excited that you are here to check out my work and learn a little bit about me!
             You've heard the story. I was a girl obsessed with taking pictures from the time I was little. 
             It's true! However my love of taking pictures came from watching my dad capture beauty on a canvas. 
             As a professional artist he taught me how to notice how lovely the sunlight was coming through the tree branches,
             or how to see the contrast in colors between cool distant mountains and bright yellow fields. 
             Multiple copies of art magazines could always be found in my home and I was always studying them; the color, the poses, 
             the emotion. I decided I wanted to capture beauty as well, but my instrument of choice was and still is my camera.
             My sessions are filled with laughter and it's normal for donuts to magically appear afterwards. 
             I believe the greatest pictures are simply snapshots of a genuine moment and I love working with my clients to create those moments. 
             So if you're looking for timeless photos, a fun adventure and for a new friend (me!!!) I think you just found your girl.</p>
